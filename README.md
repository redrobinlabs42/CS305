Journal 8 for CS305 - Software Security.

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a finanical consulting firm that had hired Global Rain to develop a web application for their digital transformation. Artemis Financil is in the business of accounts for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Global Rain wants built the ability to access accounts, and their primary concern is the verification of data transfer for security reasons.

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

One of the strengths of this project was generating checksum values based on various different encryption algorithms to ensure data validation regardless of security protocol. Securely programming should be the most important aspect of coding. Some examples of this are ensuring the customers data security as well as that of the company. Privay is very importan to take seriously in these day and ages.

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I thought that the dependency checks were pretty tough epecially since the instructions were so vague. I did find it to be pretty educational which was a great advantage of the difficulty of the project.

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My approach involved creating multiple layers of security by utilizing encryption algorithms. I learned that different algorithms are better for certain tasks such as reading files, authentication, and so much more. 

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I tested the entire surface area of the code. I checked for the proper usage of internal and external dependencies. After each change I checked each stage of the security check to ensure that I did no introduce more issues.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Mostly reading the docs a few times over was the key to unblocking myself.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would show them the vulnerability reports and the false flag warnings. I think that both of them are used for showing the employer that I know how to find issues along with eliminate the ones that are not important.
