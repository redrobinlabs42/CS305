Journal 8 for CS305 - Software Security.

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a finanical consulting firm that had hired Global Rain to develop a web application for their digital transformation. Artemis Financil is in the business of accounts for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Global Rain wants built the ability to access accounts, and their primary concern is the verification of data transfer for security reasons. They also really care about customer identity since that is a huge topic in computer science. I addressed all of these requirements in the project and had a great time solving the problem for them.

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

One of the strengths of this project was generating checksum values based on various different encryption algorithms to ensure data validation regardless of security protocol. Securely programming should be the most important aspect of coding to ensure that downstream effects do not happen. Some examples of this are ensuring the customers data security as well as that of the companies internal communications. Privacy is very importan to take seriously in these day and ages especially with the explosion of FinTech.

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I thought that the dependency checks were pretty tough epecially since the instructions were not native to MacOS. It took a decent amount of translating back and forth. I did find it to be pretty educational which was a great advantage of the difficulty of the project. The resolution to the difficulty was to read the docs accordingly and look up similar projects for Unix based systems.

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My approach involved creating multiple layers of security by utilizing encryption algorithms and implementing them to the best of my abilities. I learned that different algorithms are better for certain tasks such as reading files, authentication, and so much more. For future projects it requires sitting down and combing through a book of advanced algorithms to figure out the best technique to implement such a thing.

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I tested the entire surface area of the code. I checked for the proper usage of internal and external dependencies. After each change I checked each stage of the security check to ensure that I did no introduce more issues. This was a rigorous process but it ensured the best results for the testing.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Mostly reading the docs a few times over was the key to unblocking myself.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would show them the vulnerability reports and the false flag warnings. I think that both of them are used for showing the employer that I know how to find issues along with eliminate the ones that are not important.
